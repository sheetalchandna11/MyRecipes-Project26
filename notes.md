Notes:-

You can skip the gelatin for the frosting, but I added it to stabilize the cream. As whipped cream frosting is pretty unstable if left out for a long time, I like to use it sans the gelatin when I'm making a simple rustic frosted cake. I wanted this frosting to stay well and hold its shape and hence added gelatin. You may use agar agar powder, use the same quantity and add it directly to the cream when it has thickened, and continue beating until it forms stiff peaks. For an eggless butterscotch cake, you can follow my eggless rasmalai cake base recipe, another tried and tested cake recipe by many readers. Simply flavor the cake base with butterscotch essence and syrup. The rest of this cake recipe remains the same. Skip the gelatin to keep it vegetarian-friendly.
